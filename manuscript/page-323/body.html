we shall find the case the same.  It is the same, for instance,
in the deep matter of the Trinity.  Unitarians (a sect never to be
mentioned without a special respect for their distinguished intellectual
dignity and high intellectual honour) are often reformers by the
accident that throws so many small sects into such an attitude.
But there is nothing in the least liberal or akin to reform in

God of the Athanasian Creed may be an enigma for the intellect;
but He is far less likely to gather the mystery and cruelty

who is a mere awful unity is not only a king but an Eastern king.

pleads as well as justice, the conception</p></div> </div>
