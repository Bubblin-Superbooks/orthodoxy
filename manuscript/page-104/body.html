even if he does them badly.  I am not here arguing the truth of any
of these conceptions; I know that some moderns are asking to have
their wives chosen by scientists, and they may soon be asking,
for all I know, to have their noses blown by nurses.  I merely

the democratic faith is this:  that the most terribly important things
must be left to ordinary men themselvesâ€”the mating of the sexes,
the rearing of the young, the laws of the state.  This is democracy;

able to understand.  I have never been able to understand where people
got the idea that democracy was in some way opposed to tradition.
