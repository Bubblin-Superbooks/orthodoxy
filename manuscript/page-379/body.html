the case is opposite; it is its outer ring that is obviously
artistic and emancipated; its despair is within.</p><p>And its despair is this, that it does not really believe
that there is any meaning in the universe; therefore it cannot
hope to find any romance; its romances will have no plots.  A man
cannot expect any adventures in the land of anarchy.  But a man can
expect any number of adventures if he goes travelling in the land
of authority.  One can find no meanings in a jungle of scepticism;
but the man will find more and more meanings who walks through
a forest of doctrine and design.  Here everything has a story tied
to its tail, like the tools or pictures in my father's house;
for it is my father's house.  I end where I beganâ€”at the right end.
I have entered at last the gate of all good philosophy.  I have come
into my second childhood.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But this larger and more adventurous Christian</p></div> </div>
