Many critics\ncomplained of the book called \"Heretics\" because it merely criticised\ncurrent philosophies without offering any alternative philosophy.\nThis book is an attempt to answer the challenge.  It is unavoidably\naffirmative and therefore unavoidably autobiographical.  The writer has\nbeen driven back upon somewhat the same difficulty as that which beset\nNewman in writing his Apologia; he has been forced to be egotistical\nonly in order to be sincere.  While everything else may be different\nthe motive in both cases is the same.  It is the purpose of the writer\nto attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian Faith can\nbe believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it.\nThe book is therefore arranged upon the positive principle of a riddle\nand its answer.  It deals first with all the writer's own solitary\nand sincere speculations and then with all the startling style in\nwhich they were all suddenly satisfied by the Christian Theology.\nThe writer regards it as amounting to a convincing creed.  But if\nit is not that it is at least a repeated and surprising coincidence."

If he does read it, he will find that in\nits pages I have attempted in a vague and personal way, in a set\nof mental pictures rather than in a series of deductions, to state\nthe philosophy in which I have come to believe.

There will probably be a general\nimpression that the man who landed (armed to the teeth and talking\nby signs) to plant the British flag on that barbaric temple which\nturned out to be the Pavilion at Brighton, felt rather a fool.\nI am not here concerned to deny that he looked a fool.  But if you\nimagine that he felt a fool, or at any rate that the sense of folly\nwas his sole or his dominant emotion, then you have not studied\nwith sufficient delicacy the rich romantic nature of the hero\nof this tale.  His mistake was really a most enviable mistake;\nand he knew it, if he was the man I take him for.  What could\nbe more delightful than to have in the same few minutes all the\nfascinating terrors of going abroad combined with all the humane\nsecurity of coming home again?  What could be better than to have\nall the fun of discovering South Africa without the disgusting\nnecessity of landing there?  What could be more glorious than to\nbrace one's self up to discover New South Wales and then realize,\nwith a gush of happy tears, that it was really old South Wales.\nThis at least seems to me the main problem for philosophers, and is\nin a manner the main problem of this book.  How can we contrive\nto be at once astonished at the world and yet at home in it?\nHow can this queer cosmic town, with its many-legged citizens,\nwith its monstrous and ancient lamps, how can this world give us\nat once the fascination of a strange town and the comfort and honour\nof being our own town?"

If a man says that extinction is better\nthan existence or blank existence better than variety and adventure,\nthen he is not one of the ordinary people to whom I am talking.\nIf a man prefers nothing I can give him nothing.  But nearly all\npeople I have ever met in this western society in which I live\nwould agree to the general proposition that we need this life\nof practical romance; the combination of something that is strange\nwith something that is secure.

Whether or no man could be washed in miraculous\nwaters, there was no doubt at any rate that he wanted washing.\nBut certain religious leaders in London, not mere materialists,\nhave begun in our day not to deny the highly disputable water,\nbut to deny the indisputable dirt.  Certain new theologians dispute\noriginal sin, which is the only part of Christian theology which can\nreally be proved.

    "innerHtml": "Let us begin, then, with the mad-house; from this evil and fantastic\ninn let us set forth on our intellectual journey.  Now, if we are\nto glance at the philosophy of sanity, the first thing to do in the\nmatter is to blot out one big and common mistake.  There is a notion\nadrift everywhere that imagination, especially mystical imagination,\nis dangerous to man's mental balance.  Poets are commonly spoken of as\npsychologically unreliable; and generally there is a vague association\nbetween wreathing laurels in your hair and sticking straws in it.\nFacts and history utterly contradict this view.  Most of the very\ngreat poets have been not only sane, but extremely business-like;\nand if Shakespeare ever really held horses, it was because he was much\nthe safest man to hold them.  Imagination does not breed insanity.\nExactly what does breed insanity is reason.  Poets do not go mad;\nbut chess-players do.  Mathematicians go mad, and cashiers;\nbut creative artists very seldom.  I am not, as will be seen,\nin any sense attacking logic:  I only say that this danger does\nlie in logic, not in imagination.  Artistic paternity is as\nwholesome as physical paternity.  Moreover, it is worthy of remark\nthat when a poet really was morbid it was commonly because he had\nsome weak spot of rationality on his brain.  Poe, for instance,\nreally was morbid; not because he was poetical, but because he\nwas specially analytical.  Even chess was too poetical for him;\nhe disliked chess because it was full of knights and castles,\nlike a poem.  He avowedly preferred the black discs of draughts,\nbecause they were more like the mere black dots on a diagram.\nPerhaps the strongest case of all is this:  that only one great English\npoet went mad, Cowper.  And he was definitely driven mad by logic,\nby the ugly and alien logic of predestination.  Poetry was not\nthe disease, but the medicine; poetry partly kept him in health.\nHe could sometimes forget the red and thirsty hell to which his\nhideous necessitarianism dragged him among the wide waters and\nthe white flat lilies of the Ouse.  He was damned by John Calvin;\nhe was almost saved by John Gilpin.  Everywhere we see that men\ndo not go mad by dreaming.  Critics are much madder than poets.\nHomer is complete and calm enough; it is his critics who tear him\ninto extravagant tatters.  Shakespeare is quite himself; it is only\nsome of his critics who have discovered that he was somebody else.\nAnd though St. John the Evangelist saw many strange monsters in\nhis vision, he saw no creature so wild as one of his own commentators.\nThe general fact is simple.  Poetry is sane because it floats\neasily in an infinite sea; reason seeks to cross the infinite sea,\nand so make it finite.  The result is mental exhaustion,\nlike the physical exhaustion of Mr. Holbein.  To accept everything\nis an exercise, to understand everything a strain.  The poet only\ndesires exaltation and expansion, a world to stretch himself in.\nThe poet only asks to get his head into the heavens.  It is the logician\nwho seeks to get the heavens into his head.  And it is his head\nthat splits."

I do not dwell here upon the disastrous lapse\nin determinist logic.  Obviously if any actions, even a lunatic's,\ncan be causeless, determinism is done for.  If the chain of\ncausation can be broken for a madman, it can be broken for a man.\nBut my purpose is to point out something more practical.\nIt was natural, perhaps, that a modern Marxian Socialist should not\nknow anything about free will.  But it was certainly remarkable that\na modern Marxian Socialist should not know anything about lunatics.\nMr. Suthers evidently did not know anything about lunatics.\nThe last thing that can be said of a lunatic is that his actions\nare causeless.  If any human acts may loosely be called causeless,\nthey are the minor acts of a healthy man; whistling as he walks;\nslashing the grass with a stick; kicking his heels or rubbing\nhis hands.  It is the happy man who does the useless things;\nthe sick man is not strong enough to be idle.  It is exactly such\ncareless and causeless actions that the madman could never understand;\nfor the madman (like the determinist) generally sees too much cause\nin everything.  The madman would read a conspiratorial significance\ninto those empty activities.  He would think that the lopping\nof the grass was an attack on private property.  He would think\nthat the kicking of the heels was a signal to an accomplice.\nIf the madman could for an instant become careless, he would\nbecome sane.  Every one who has had the misfortune to talk with people\nin the heart or on the edge of mental disorder, knows that their\nmost sinister quality is a horrible clarity of detail; a connecting\nof one thing with another in a map more elaborate than a maze.\nIf you argue with a madman, it is extremely probable that you will\nget the worst of it; for in many ways his mind moves all the quicker\nfor not being delayed by the things that go with good judgment.\nHe is not hampered by a sense of humour or by charity, or by the dumb\ncertainties of experience.  He is the more logical for losing certain\nsane affections.  Indeed, the common phrase for insanity is in this\nrespect a misleading one.  The madman is not the man who has lost\nhis reason.

A man cannot think himself\nout of mental evil; for it is actually the organ of thought that has\nbecome diseased, ungovernable, and, as it were, independent.  He can\nonly be saved by will or faith.  The moment his mere reason moves,\nit moves in the old circular rut; he will go round and round his\nlogical circle, just as a man in a third-class carriage on the Inner\nCircle will go round and round the Inner Circle unless he performs\nthe voluntary, vigorous, and mystical act of getting out at Gower Street.\nDecision is the whole business here; a door must be shut for ever.\nEvery remedy is a desperate remedy.  Every cure is a miraculous cure.\nCuring a madman is not arguing with a philosopher; it is casting\nout a devil.  And however quietly doctors and psychologists may go\nto work in the matter, their attitude is profoundly intolerant—\nas intolerant as Bloody Mary.  Their attitude is really this:\nthat the man must stop thinking, if he is to go on living.\nTheir counsel is one of intellectual amputation.  If thy HEAD\noffend thee, cut it off; for it is better, not merely to enter\nthe Kingdom of Heaven as a child, but to enter it as an imbecile,\nrather than with your whole intellect to be cast into hell—\nor into Hanwell."

And for the rest of these pages\nwe have to try and discover what is the right end.  But we may ask\nin conclusion, if this be what drives men mad, what is it that keeps\nthem sane?  By the end of this book I hope to give a definite,\nsome will think a far too definite, answer.  But for the moment it\nis possible in the same solely practical manner to give a general\nanswer touching what in actual human history keeps men sane.\nMysticism keeps men sane.  As long as you have mystery you have health;\nwhen you destroy mystery you create morbidity.  The ordinary man has\nalways been sane because the ordinary man has always been a mystic.\nHe has permitted the twilight.  He has always had one foot in earth\nand the other in fairyland.  He has always left himself free to doubt\nhis gods; but (unlike the agnostic of to-day) free also to believe\nin them.  He has always cared more for truth than for consistency.\nIf he saw two truths that seemed to contradict each other,\nhe would take the two truths and the contradiction along with them.\nHis spiritual sight is stereoscopic, like his physical sight:\nhe sees two different pictures at once and yet sees all the better\nfor that.  Thus he has always believed that there was such a thing\nas fate, but such a thing as free will also.  Thus he believed\nthat children were indeed the kingdom of heaven, but nevertheless\nought to be obedient to the kingdom of earth.  He admired youth\nbecause it was young and age because it was not.  It is exactly\nthis balance of apparent contradictions that has been the whole\nbuoyancy of the healthy man.  The whole secret of mysticism is this:\nthat man can understand everything by the help of what he does\nnot understand.  The morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid,\nand succeeds in making everything mysterious.  The mystic allows\none thing to be mysterious, and everything else becomes lucid.\nThe determinist makes the theory of causation quite clear,\nand then finds that he cannot say \"if you please\" to the housemaid.\nThe Christian permits free will to remain a sacred mystery; but because\nof this his relations with the housemaid become of a sparkling and\ncrystal clearness.  He puts the seed of dogma in a central darkness;\nbut it branches forth in all directions with abounding natural health.\nAs we have taken the circle as the symbol of reason and madness,\nwe may very well take the cross as the symbol at once of mystery and\nof health.  Buddhism is centripetal, but Christianity is centrifugal:\nit breaks out.  For the circle is perfect and infinite in its nature;\nbut it is fixed for ever in its size; it can never be larger\nor smaller.  But the cross, though it has at its heart a collision\nand a contradiction, can extend its four arms for ever without\naltering its shape.  Because it has a paradox in its centre it can\ngrow without changing.  The circle returns upon itself and is bound.\nThe cross opens its arms to the four winds; it is a signpost for free\ntravellers."

Like the sun at noonday,\nmysticism explains everything else by the blaze of its own\nvictorious invisibility.  Detached intellectualism is (in the\nexact sense of a popular phrase) all moonshine; for it is light\nwithout heat, and it is secondary light, reflected from a dead world.\nBut the Greeks were right when they made Apollo the god both of\nimagination and of sanity; for he was both the patron of poetry\nand the patron of healing.

It means that there is no such thing as a thing.\nAt best, there is only one thing, and that is a flux of everything\nand anything.  This is an attack not upon the faith, but upon\nthe mind; you cannot think if there are no things to think about.\nYou cannot think if you are not separate from the subject of thought.\nDescartes said, \"I think; therefore I am.\"  The philosophic evolutionist\nreverses and negatives the epigram.

A man\ndoes not go mad because he makes a statue a mile high, but he\nmay go mad by thinking it out in square inches.  Now, one school\nof thinkers has seen this and jumped at it as a way of renewing\nthe pagan health of the world.  They see that reason destroys;\nbut Will, they say, creates.  The ultimate authority, they say,\nis in will, not in reason.  The supreme point is not why\na man demands a thing, but the fact that he does demand it.\nI have no space to trace or expound this philosophy of Will.\nIt came, I suppose, through Nietzsche, who preached something\nthat is called egoism.  That, indeed, was simpleminded enough;\nfor Nietzsche denied egoism simply by preaching it.  To preach\nanything is to give it away.  First, the egoist calls life a war\nwithout mercy, and then he takes the greatest possible trouble to\ndrill his enemies in war.  To preach egoism is to practise altruism.\nBut however it began, the view is common enough in current literature.\nThe main defence of these thinkers is that they are not thinkers;\nthey are makers.  They say that choice is itself the divine thing.\nThus Mr. Bernard Shaw has attacked the old idea that men's acts\nare to be judged by the standard of the desire of happiness.\nHe says that a man does not act for his happiness, but from his will.\nHe does not say, \"Jam will make me happy,\" but \"I want jam.\"\nAnd in all this others follow him with yet greater enthusiasm.\nMr. John Davidson, a remarkable poet, is so passionately excited\nabout it that he is obliged to write prose.  He publishes a short\nplay with several long prefaces.  This is natural enough in Mr. Shaw,\nfor all his plays are prefaces:  Mr. Shaw is (I suspect) the only man\non earth who has never written any poetry.  But that Mr. Davidson (who\ncan write excellent poetry) should write instead laborious metaphysics\nin defence of this doctrine of will, does show that the doctrine\nof will has taken hold of men.  Even Mr. H.G.Wells has half spoken\nin its language; saying that one should test acts not like a thinker,\nbut like an artist, saying, \"I FEEL this curve is right,\" or \"that\nline SHALL go thus.\"  They are all excited; and well they may be.\nFor by this doctrine of the divine authority of will, they think they\ncan break out of the doomed fortress of rationalism.  They think they\ncan escape."

The real difference between the test\nof happiness and the test of will is simply that the test of\nhappiness is a test and the other isn't. You can discuss whether\na man's act in jumping over a cliff was directed towards happiness;\nyou cannot discuss whether it was derived from will.  Of course\nit was.  You can praise an action by saying that it is calculated\nto bring pleasure or pain to discover truth or to save the soul.\nBut you cannot praise an action because it shows will; for to say\nthat is merely to say that it is an action.

A brilliant anarchist like Mr. John\nDavidson feels an irritation against ordinary morality, and therefore\nhe invokes will—will to anything.  He only wants humanity to want\nsomething.

And if any one wants a proof of this, it can be found\nquite easily.  It can be found in this fact:  that they always talk\nof will as something that expands and breaks out.  But it is quite\nthe opposite.  Every act of will is an act of self-limitation. To\ndesire action is to desire limitation.  In that sense every act\nis an act of self-sacrifice. When you choose anything, you reject\neverything else.  That objection, which men of this school used\nto make to the act of marriage, is really an objection to every act.\nEvery act is an irrevocable selection and exclusion.  Just as when\nyou marry one woman you give up all the others, so when you take\none course of action you give up all the other courses.  If you\nbecome King of England, you give up the post of Beadle in Brompton.\nIf you go to Rome, you sacrifice a rich suggestive life in Wimbledon.\nIt is the existence of this negative or limiting side of will that\nmakes most of the talk of the anarchic will-worshippers little\nbetter than nonsense.  For instance, Mr. John Davidson tells us\nto have nothing to do with \"Thou shalt not\"; but it is surely obvious\nthat \"Thou shalt not\" is only one of the necessary corollaries\nof \"I will.\"  \"I will go to the Lord Mayor's Show, and thou shalt\nnot stop me.\"  Anarchism adjures us to be bold creative artists,\nand care for no laws or limits.  But it is impossible to be\nan artist and not care for laws and limits.  Art is limitation;\nthe essence of every picture is the frame.  If you draw a giraffe,\nyou must draw him with a long neck.  If, in your bold creative way,\nyou hold yourself free to draw a giraffe with a short neck,\nyou will really find that you are not free to draw a giraffe.\nThe moment you step into the world of facts, you step into a world\nof limits.  You can free things from alien or accidental laws,\nbut not from the laws of their own nature.  You may, if you like,\nfree a tiger from his bars; but do not free him from his stripes.\nDo not free a camel of the burden of his hump:  you may be freeing him\nfrom being a camel.  Do not go about as a demagogue, encouraging triangles\nto break out of the prison of their three sides.  If a triangle\nbreaks out of its three sides, its life comes to a lamentable end.\nSomebody wrote a work called \"The Loves of the Triangles\";\nI never read it, but I am sure that if triangles ever were loved,\nthey were loved for being triangular.  This is certainly the case\nwith all artistic creation, which is in some ways the most\ndecisive example of pure will.  The artist loves his limitations:\nthey constitute the THING he is doing.

But the new rebel is a Sceptic,\nand will not entirely trust anything.  He has no loyalty; therefore he\ncan never be really a revolutionist.  And the fact that he doubts\neverything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything.\nFor all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind; and the\nmodern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces,\nbut the doctrine by which he denounces it.  Thus he writes one book\ncomplaining that imperial oppression insults the purity of women,\nand then he writes another book (about the sex problem) in which he\ninsults it himself.

A man denounces marriage\nas a lie, and then denounces aristocratic profligates for treating\nit as a lie.

Yet Joan,\nwhen I came to think of her, had in her all that was true either in\nTolstoy or Nietzsche, all that was even tolerable in either of them.\nI thought of all that is noble in Tolstoy, the pleasure in plain\nthings, especially in plain pity, the actualities of the earth,\nthe reverence for the poor, the dignity of the bowed back.\nJoan of Arc had all that and with this great addition, that she\nendured poverty as well as admiring it; whereas Tolstoy is only a\ntypical aristocrat trying to find out its secret.  And then I thought\nof all that was brave and proud and pathetic in poor Nietzsche,\nand his mutiny against the emptiness and timidity of our time.\nI thought of his cry for the ecstatic equilibrium of danger, his hunger\nfor the rush of great horses, his cry to arms.  Well, Joan of Arc\nhad all that, and again with this difference, that she did not\npraise fighting, but fought.  We KNOW that she was not afraid\nof an army, while Nietzsche, for all we know, was afraid of a cow.\nTolstoy only praised the peasant; she was the peasant.  Nietzsche only\npraised the warrior; she was the warrior.  She beat them both at\ntheir own antagonistic ideals; she was more gentle than the one,\nmore violent than the other.  Yet she was a perfectly practical person\nwho did something, while they are wild speculators who do nothing.\nIt was impossible that the thought should not cross my mind that she\nand her faith had perhaps some secret of moral unity and utility\nthat has been lost.  And with that thought came a larger one,\nand the colossal figure of her Master had also crossed the theatre\nof my thoughts.  The same modern difficulty which darkened the\nsubject-matter of Anatole France also darkened that of Ernest Renan.\nRenan also divided his hero's pity from his hero's pugnacity.\nRenan even represented the righteous anger at Jerusalem as a mere\nnervous breakdown after the idyllic expectations of Galilee.\nAs if there were any inconsistency between having a love for\nhumanity and having a hatred for inhumanity!

Egoists (with\neven thinner and weaker voices) denounce Him as an altruist.\nIn our present atmosphere such cavils are comprehensible enough.\nThe love of a hero is more terrible than the hatred of a tyrant.\nThe hatred of a hero is more generous than the love of a philanthropist.\nThere is a huge and heroic sanity of which moderns can only collect\nthe fragments.

They are, in the true\nsense of the word, necessary.  Such are mathematical and merely\nlogical sequences.  We in fairyland (who are the most reasonable\nof all creatures) admit that reason and that necessity.\nFor instance, if the Ugly Sisters are older than Cinderella,\nit is (in an iron and awful sense) NECESSARY that Cinderella is\nyounger than the Ugly Sisters.  There is no getting out of it.\nHaeckel may talk as much fatalism about that fact as he pleases:\nit really must be.  If Jack is the son of a miller, a miller is\nthe father of Jack.  Cold reason decrees it from her awful throne:\nand we in fairyland submit.  If the three brothers all ride horses,\nthere are six animals and eighteen legs involved:  that is true\nrationalism, and fairyland is full of it.  But as I put my head over\nthe hedge of the elves and began to take notice of the natural world,\nI observed an extraordinary thing.  I observed that learned men\nin spectacles were talking of the actual things that happened—\ndawn and death and so on—as if THEY were rational and inevitable.\nThey talked as if the fact that trees bear fruit were just as NECESSARY\nas the fact that two and one trees make three.  But it is not.\nThere is an enormous difference by the test of fairyland; which is\nthe test of the imagination.  You cannot IMAGINE two and one not\nmaking three.  But you can easily imagine trees not growing fruit;\nyou can imagine them growing golden candlesticks or tigers hanging\non by the tail.  These men in spectacles spoke much of a man\nnamed Newton, who was hit by an apple, and who discovered a law.\nBut they could not be got to see the distinction between a true law,\na law of reason, and the mere fact of apples falling.  If the apple hit\nNewton's nose, Newton's nose hit the apple.  That is a true necessity:\nbecause we cannot conceive the one occurring without the other.\nBut we can quite well conceive the apple not falling on his nose;\nwe can fancy it flying ardently through the air to hit some other nose,\nof which it had a more definite dislike.  We have always in our fairy\ntales kept this sharp distinction between the science of mental relations,\nin which there really are laws, and the science of physical facts,\nin which there are no laws, but only weird repetitions.  We believe\nin bodily miracles, but not in mental impossibilities.

The tales are, at any rate, certainly tales;\nwhile the law is not a law.  A law implies that we know the nature\nof the generalisation and enactment; not merely that we have noticed\nsome of the effects.  If there is a law that pick-pockets shall go\nto prison, it implies that there is an imaginable mental connection\nbetween the idea of prison and the idea of picking pockets.\nAnd we know what the idea is.  We can say why we take liberty\nfrom a man who takes liberties.  But we cannot say why an egg can\nturn into a chicken any more than we can say why a bear could turn\ninto a fairy prince.  As IDEAS, the egg and the chicken are further\noff from each other than the bear and the prince; for no egg in\nitself suggests a chicken, whereas some princes do suggest bears.\nGranted, then, that certain transformations do happen, it is essential\nthat we should regard them in the philosophic manner of fairy tales,\nnot in the unphilosophic manner of science and the \"Laws of Nature.\"\nWhen we are asked why eggs turn to birds or fruits fall in autumn,\nwe must answer exactly as the fairy godmother would answer\nif Cinderella asked her why mice turned to horses or her clothes\nfell from her at twelve o'clock. We must answer that it is MAGIC.\nIt is not a \"law,\" for we do not understand its general formula.\nIt is not a necessity, for though we can count on it happening\npractically, we have no right to say that it must always happen.\nIt is no argument for unalterable law (as Huxley fancied) that we\ncount on the ordinary course of things.  We do not count on it;\nwe bet on it.  We risk the remote possibility of a miracle as we\ndo that of a poisoned pancake or a world-destroying comet.\nWe leave it out of account, not because it is a miracle, and therefore\nan impossibility, but because it is a miracle, and therefore\nan exception.  All the terms used in the science books, \"law,\"\n\"necessity,\" \"order,\" \"tendency,\" and so on, are really unintellectual,\nbecause they assume an inner synthesis, which we do not possess.\nThe only words that ever satisfied me as describing Nature are the\nterms used in the fairy books, \"charm,\" \"spell,\" \"enchantment.\"\nThey express the arbitrariness of the fact and its mystery.\nA tree grows fruit because it is a MAGIC tree.

Both these statements being obviously\nraving nonsense, one had to cast about for other explanations.\nAn optimist could not mean a man who thought everything right and\nnothing wrong.  For that is meaningless; it is like calling everything\nright and nothing left.  Upon the whole, I came to the conclusion\nthat the optimist thought everything good except the pessimist,\nand that the pessimist thought everything bad, except himself.\nIt would be unfair to omit altogether from the list the mysterious\nbut suggestive definition said to have been given by a little girl,\n\"An optimist is a man who looks after your eyes, and a pessimist\nis a man who looks after your feet.\"  I am not sure that this is not\nthe best definition of all.

One wants something\nto begin:  the other wants everything to end.  In other words,\nthe martyr is noble, exactly because (however he renounces the world\nor execrates all humanity) he confesses this ultimate link with life;\nhe sets his heart outside himself:  he dies that something may live.\nThe suicide is ignoble because he has not this link with being:\nhe is a mere destroyer; spiritually, he destroys the universe.\nAnd then I remembered the stake and the cross-roads, and the queer\nfact that Christianity had shown this weird harshness to the suicide.\nFor Christianity had shown a wild encouragement of the martyr.\nHistoric Christianity was accused, not entirely without reason,\nof carrying martyrdom and asceticism to a point, desolate\nand pessimistic.  The early Christian martyrs talked of death\nwith a horrible happiness.  They blasphemed the beautiful duties\nof the body:  they smelt the grave afar off like a field of flowers.\nAll this has seemed to many the very poetry of pessimism.  Yet there\nis the stake at the crossroads to show what Christianity thought of\nthe pessimist."

It was not a matter of degree.\nIt was not that a line must be drawn somewhere, and that the\nself-slayer in exaltation fell within the line, the self-slayer\nin sadness just beyond it.

One man flung away his life;\nhe was so good that his dry bones could heal cities in pestilence.\nAnother man flung away life; he was so bad that his bones would\npollute his brethren's.

They talk as if\nthere had never been any piety or pity until Christianity came,\na point on which any mediaeval would have been eager to correct them.\nThey represent that the remarkable thing about Christianity was that it\nwas the first to preach simplicity or self-restraint, or inwardness\nand sincerity.  They will think me very narrow (whatever that means)\nif I say that the remarkable thing about Christianity was that it\nwas the first to preach Christianity.  Its peculiarity was that it\nwas peculiar, and simplicity and sincerity are not peculiar,\nbut obvious ideals for all mankind.  Christianity was the answer\nto a riddle, not the last truism uttered after a long talk.\nOnly the other day I saw in an excellent weekly paper of Puritan tone\nthis remark, that Christianity when stripped of its armour of dogma\n(as who should speak of a man stripped of his armour of bones),\nturned out to be nothing but the Quaker doctrine of the Inner Light.\nNow, if I were to say that Christianity came into the world\nspecially to destroy the doctrine of the Inner Light, that would\nbe an exaggeration.  But it would be very much nearer to the truth.\nThe last Stoics, like Marcus Aurelius, were exactly the people\nwho did believe in the Inner Light.  Their dignity, their weariness,\ntheir sad external care for others, their incurable internal care\nfor themselves, were all due to the Inner Light, and existed only\nby that dismal illumination.  Notice that Marcus Aurelius insists,\nas such introspective moralists always do, upon small things done\nor undone; it is because he has not hate or love enough to make\na moral revolution.  He gets up early in the morning, just as our\nown aristocrats living the Simple Life get up early in the morning;\nbecause such altruism is much easier than stopping the games\nof the amphitheatre or giving the English people back their land.\nMarcus Aurelius is the most intolerable of human types.  He is an\nunselfish egoist.  An unselfish egoist is a man who has pride without\nthe excuse of passion.  Of all conceivable forms of enlightenment\nthe worst is what these people call the Inner Light.  Of all horrible\nreligions the most horrible is the worship of the god within.\nAny one who knows any body knows how it would work; any one who knows\nany one from the Higher Thought Centre knows how it does work.\nThat Jones shall worship the god within him turns out ultimately\nto mean that Jones shall worship Jones.  Let Jones worship the sun\nor moon, anything rather than the Inner Light; let Jones worship\ncats or crocodiles, if he can find any in his street, but not\nthe god within.  Christianity came into the world firstly in order\nto assert with violence that a man had not only to look inwards,\nbut to look outwards, to behold with astonishment and enthusiasm\na divine company and a divine captain.  The only fun of being\na Christian was that a man was not left alone with the Inner Light,\nbut definitely recognized an outer light, fair as the sun, clear as\nthe moon, terrible as an army with banners."

He thinks that because the sun gives people sun-stroke,\nhe may give his neighbour measles.  He thinks that because the moon\nis said to drive men mad, he may drive his wife mad.  This ugly side\nof mere external optimism had also shown itself in the ancient world.\nAbout the time when the Stoic idealism had begun to show the\nweaknesses of pessimism, the old nature worship of the ancients had\nbegun to show the enormous weaknesses of optimism.  Nature worship\nis natural enough while the society is young, or, in other words,\nPantheism is all right as long as it is the worship of Pan.\nBut Nature has another side which experience and sin are not slow\nin finding out, and it is no flippancy to say of the god Pan that he\nsoon showed the cloven hoof.  The only objection to Natural Religion\nis that somehow it always becomes unnatural.  A man loves Nature\nin the morning for her innocence and amiability, and at nightfall,\nif he is loving her still, it is for her darkness and her cruelty.\nHe washes at dawn in clear water as did the Wise Man of the Stoics,\nyet, somehow at the dark end of the day, he is bathing in hot\nbull's blood, as did Julian the Apostate.  The mere pursuit of\nhealth always leads to something unhealthy.  Physical nature must\nnot be made the direct object of obedience; it must be enjoyed,\nnot worshipped.  Stars and mountains must not be taken seriously.\nIf they are, we end where the pagan nature worship ended.\nBecause the earth is kind, we can imitate all her cruelties.\nBecause sexuality is sane, we can all go mad about sexuality.\nMere optimism had reached its insane and appropriate termination.\nThe theory that everything was good had become an orgy of everything\nthat was bad."

As I am here only concerned\nwith their particular problem, I shall indicate only briefly this\ngreat metaphysical suggestion.  All descriptions of the creating\nor sustaining principle in things must be metaphorical, because they\nmust be verbal.  Thus the pantheist is forced to speak of God\nin all things as if he were in a box.  Thus the evolutionist has,\nin his very name, the idea of being unrolled like a carpet.\nAll terms, religious and irreligious, are open to this charge.\nThe only question is whether all terms are useless, or whether one can,\nwith such a phrase, cover a distinct IDEA about the origin of things.\nI think one can, and so evidently does the evolutionist, or he would\nnot talk about evolution.  And the root phrase for all Christian\ntheism was this, that God was a creator, as an artist is a creator.\nA poet is so separate from his poem that he himself speaks of it\nas a little thing he has \"thrown off.\"  Even in giving it forth he\nhas flung it away.

Christianity (it\nmay reasonably be said) is one thing confined to one kind of people;\nit began in Palestine, it has practically stopped with Europe.\nI was duly impressed with this argument in my youth, and I was much\ndrawn towards the doctrine often preached in Ethical Societies—\nI mean the doctrine that there is one great unconscious church of\nall humanity founded on the omnipresence of the human conscience.\nCreeds, it was said, divided men; but at least morals united them.\nThe soul might seek the strangest and most remote lands and ages\nand still find essential ethical common sense.  It might find\nConfucius under Eastern trees, and he would be writing \"Thou\nshalt not steal.\"  It might decipher the darkest hieroglyphic on\nthe most primeval desert, and the meaning when deciphered would\nbe \"Little boys should tell the truth.\"  I believed this doctrine\nof the brotherhood of all men in the possession of a moral sense,\nand I believe it still—with other things.  And I was thoroughly\nannoyed with Christianity for suggesting (as I supposed)\nthat whole ages and empires of men had utterly escaped this light\nof justice and reason.  But then I found an astonishing thing.\nI found that the very people who said that mankind was one church\nfrom Plato to Emerson were the very people who said that morality\nhad changed altogether, and that what was right in one age was wrong\nin another.  If I asked, say, for an altar, I was told that we\nneeded none, for men our brothers gave us clear oracles and one creed\nin their universal customs and ideals.  But if I mildly pointed\nout that one of men's universal customs was to have an altar,\nthen my agnostic teachers turned clean round and told me that men\nhad always been in darkness and the superstitions of savages.\nI found it was their daily taunt against Christianity that it was\nthe light of one people and had left all others to die in the dark.\nBut I also found that it was their special boast for themselves\nthat science and progress were the discovery of one people,\nand that all other peoples had died in the dark.  Their chief insult\nto Christianity was actually their chief compliment to themselves,\nand there seemed to be a strange unfairness about all their relative\ninsistence on the two things.  When considering some pagan or agnostic,\nwe were to remember that all men had one religion; when considering\nsome mystic or spiritualist, we were only to consider what absurd\nreligions some men had.  We could trust the ethics of Epictetus,\nbecause ethics had never changed.  We must not trust the ethics\nof Bossuet, because ethics had changed.

I saw the same thing on every side.\nI can give no further space to this discussion of it in detail;\nbut lest any one supposes that I have unfairly selected three\naccidental cases I will run briefly through a few others.\nThus, certain sceptics wrote that the great crime of Christianity\nhad been its attack on the family; it had dragged women to the\nloneliness and contemplation of the cloister, away from their homes\nand their children.  But, then, other sceptics (slightly more advanced)\nsaid that the great crime of Christianity was forcing the family\nand marriage upon us; that it doomed women to the drudgery of their\nhomes and children, and forbade them loneliness and contemplation.\nThe charge was actually reversed.  Or, again, certain phrases in the\nEpistles or the marriage service, were said by the anti-Christians\nto show contempt for woman's intellect.  But I found that the\nanti-Christians themselves had a contempt for woman's intellect;\nfor it was their great sneer at the Church on the Continent that\n\"only women\" went to it.  Or again, Christianity was reproached\nwith its naked and hungry habits; with its sackcloth and dried peas.\nBut the next minute Christianity was being reproached with its pomp\nand its ritualism; its shrines of porphyry and its robes of gold.\nIt was abused for being too plain and for being too coloured.\nAgain Christianity had always been accused of restraining sexuality\ntoo much, when Bradlaugh the Malthusian discovered that it restrained\nit too little.  It is often accused in the same breath of prim\nrespectability and of religious extravagance.  Between the covers\nof the same atheistic pamphlet I have found the faith rebuked\nfor its disunion, \"One thinks one thing, and one another,\"\nand rebuked also for its union, \"It is difference of opinion\nthat prevents the world from going to the dogs.\"  In the same\nconversation a free-thinker, a friend of mine, blamed Christianity\nfor despising Jews, and then despised it himself for being Jewish."

He might be the right shape.\nOutrageously tall men might feel him to be short.  Very short men\nmight feel him to be tall.  Old bucks who are growing stout might\nconsider him insufficiently filled out; old beaux who were growing\nthin might feel that he expanded beyond the narrow lines of elegance.\nPerhaps Swedes (who have pale hair like tow) called him a dark man,\nwhile negroes considered him distinctly blonde.

For instance,\nit was certainly odd that the modern world charged Christianity\nat once with bodily austerity and with artistic pomp.

Christianity was like\na huge and ragged and romantic rock, which, though it sways on its\npedestal at a touch, yet, because its exaggerated excrescences\nexactly balance each other, is enthroned there for a thousand years.\nIn a Gothic cathedral the columns were all different, but they were\nall necessary.  Every support seemed an accidental and fantastic support;\nevery buttress was a flying buttress.  So in Christendom apparent\naccidents balanced.  Becket wore a hair shirt under his gold\nand crimson, and there is much to be said for the combination;\nfor Becket got the benefit of the hair shirt while the people in\nthe street got the benefit of the crimson and gold.  It is at least\nbetter than the manner of the modern millionaire, who has the black\nand the drab outwardly for others, and the gold next his heart.\nBut the balance was not always in one man's body as in Becket's;\nthe balance was often distributed over the whole body of Christendom.\nBecause a man prayed and fasted on the Northern snows, flowers could\nbe flung at his festival in the Southern cities; and because fanatics\ndrank water on the sands of Syria, men could still drink cider in the\norchards of England.  This is what makes Christendom at once so much\nmore perplexing and so much more interesting than the Pagan empire;\njust as Amiens Cathedral is not better but more interesting than\nthe Parthenon.  If any one wants a modern proof of all this,\nlet him consider the curious fact that, under Christianity,\nEurope (while remaining a unity) has broken up into individual nations.\nPatriotism is a perfect example of this deliberate balancing\nof one emphasis against another emphasis.  The instinct of the\nPagan empire would have said, \"You shall all be Roman citizens,\nand grow alike; let the German grow less slow and reverent;\nthe Frenchmen less experimental and swift.\"  But the instinct\nof Christian Europe says, \"Let the German remain slow and reverent,\nthat the Frenchman may the more safely be swift and experimental.\nWe will make an equipoise out of these excesses.  The absurdity\ncalled Germany shall correct the insanity called France.\""

But the question is,\ndo we want to have longer and longer noses?  I fancy not;\nI believe that we most of us want to say to our noses, \"thus far,\nand no farther; and here shall thy proud point be stayed:\"\nwe require a nose of such length as may ensure an interesting face.\nBut we cannot imagine a mere biological trend towards producing\ninteresting faces; because an interesting face is one particular\narrangement of eyes, nose, and mouth, in a most complex relation\nto each other.  Proportion cannot be a drift:  it is either\nan accident or a design.

To so crude a consummation as that we\nmight perhaps unconsciously drift.  But do we want so crude\na consummation?  Similarly, we might unconsciously evolve along\nthe opposite or Nietzschian line of development—superman crushing\nsuperman in one tower of tyrants until the universe is smashed\nup for fun.  But do we want the universe smashed up for fun?\nIs it not quite clear that what we really hope for is one particular\nmanagement and proposition of these two things; a certain amount\nof restraint and respect, a certain amount of energy and mastery?\nIf our life is ever really as beautiful as a fairy-tale, we shall\nhave to remember that all the beauty of a fairy-tale lies in this:\nthat the prince has a wonder which just stops short of being fear.\nIf he is afraid of the giant, there is an end of him; but also if he\nis not astonished at the giant, there is an end of the fairy-tale. The\nwhole point depends upon his being at once humble enough to wonder,\nand haughty enough to defy.

We must also have enough\ndisdain for all things outside us, to make us, on due occasion,\nspit at the stars.  Yet these two things (if we are to be good\nor happy) must be combined, not in any combination, but in one\nparticular combination.  The perfect happiness of men on the earth\n(if it ever comes) will not be a flat and solid thing, like the\nsatisfaction of animals.

It is the custom in passing\nromance and journalism to talk of men suffering under old tyrannies.\nBut, as a fact, men have almost always suffered under new tyrannies;\nunder tyrannies that had been public liberties hardly twenty\nyears before.  Thus England went mad with joy over the patriotic\nmonarchy of Elizabeth; and then (almost immediately afterwards)\nwent mad with rage in the trap of the tyranny of Charles the First.\nSo, again, in France the monarchy became intolerable, not just\nafter it had been tolerated, but just after it had been adored.\nThe son of Louis the well-beloved was Louis the guillotined.\nSo in the same way in England in the nineteenth century the Radical\nmanufacturer was entirely trusted as a mere tribune of the people,\nuntil suddenly we heard the cry of the Socialist that he was a tyrant\neating the people like bread.  So again, we have almost up to the\nlast instant trusted the newspapers as organs of public opinion.\nJust recently some of us have seen (not slowly, but with a start)\nthat they are obviously nothing of the kind.  They are, by the nature\nof the case, the hobbies of a few rich men.  We have not any need\nto rebel against antiquity; we have to rebel against novelty.\nIt is the new rulers, the capitalist or the editor, who really hold\nup the modern world.

I have listened to scientific\nmen (and there are still scientific men not opposed to democracy)\nsaying that if we give the poor healthier conditions vice and wrong\nwill disappear.  I have listened to them with a horrible attention,\nwith a hideous fascination.  For it was like watching a man\nenergetically sawing from the tree the branch he is sitting on.\nIf these happy democrats could prove their case, they would strike\ndemocracy dead.  If the poor are thus utterly demoralized, it may\nor may not be practical to raise them.  But it is certainly quite\npractical to disfranchise them.  If the man with a bad bedroom cannot\ngive a good vote, then the first and swiftest deduction is that he\nshall give no vote.  The governing class may not unreasonably say:\n\"It may take us some time to reform his bedroom.  But if he is the\nbrute you say, it will take him very little time to ruin our country.\nTherefore we will take your hint and not give him the chance.\"\nIt fills me with horrible amusement to observe the way in which the\nearnest Socialist industriously lays the foundation of all aristocracy,\nexpatiating blandly upon the evident unfitness of the poor to rule.\nIt is like listening to somebody at an evening party apologising\nfor entering without evening dress, and explaining that he had\nrecently been intoxicated, had a personal habit of taking off\nhis clothes in the street, and had, moreover, only just changed\nfrom prison uniform.  At any moment, one feels, the host might say\nthat really, if it was as bad as that, he need not come in at all.\nSo it is when the ordinary Socialist, with a beaming face,\nproves that the poor, after their smashing experiences, cannot be\nreally trustworthy.  At any moment the rich may say, \"Very well,\nthen, we won't trust them,\" and bang the door in his face.\nOn the basis of Mr. Blatchford's view of heredity and environment,\nthe case for the aristocracy is quite overwhelming.

Only the Christian Church can offer any rational\nobjection to a complete confidence in the rich.  For she has maintained\nfrom the beginning that the danger was not in man's environment,\nbut in man.  Further, she has maintained that if we come to talk of a\ndangerous environment, the most dangerous environment of all is the\ncommodious environment.  I know that the most modern manufacture has\nbeen really occupied in trying to produce an abnormally large needle.\nI know that the most recent biologists have been chiefly anxious\nto discover a very small camel.

The mere minimum of the Church would be a deadly\nultimatum to the world.  For the whole modern world is absolutely\nbased on the assumption, not that the rich are necessary (which is\ntenable), but that the rich are trustworthy, which (for a Christian)\nis not tenable.  You will hear everlastingly, in all discussions\nabout newspapers, companies, aristocracies, or party politics,\nthis argument that the rich man cannot be bribed.  The fact is,\nof course, that the rich man is bribed; he has been bribed already.\nThat is why he is a rich man.  The whole case for Christianity is that\na man who is dependent upon the luxuries of this life is a corrupt man,\nspiritually corrupt, politically corrupt, financially corrupt.\nThere is one thing that Christ and all the Christian saints\nhave said with a sort of savage monotony.  They have said simply\nthat to be rich is to be in peculiar danger of moral wreck.\nIt is not demonstrably un-Christian to kill the rich as violators\nof definable justice.  It is not demonstrably un-Christian to crown\nthe rich as convenient rulers of society.  It is not certainly\nun-Christian to rebel against the rich or to submit to the rich.\nBut it is quite certainly un-Christian to trust the rich, to regard\nthe rich as more morally safe than the poor.  A Christian may\nconsistently say, \"I respect that man's rank, although he takes bribes.\"\nBut a Christian cannot say, as all modern men are saying at lunch\nand breakfast, \"a man of that rank would not take bribes.\"\nFor it is a part of Christian dogma that any man in any rank may\ntake bribes.  It is a part of Christian dogma; it also happens by\na curious coincidence that it is a part of obvious human history.\nWhen people say that a man \"in that position\" would be incorruptible,\nthere is no need to bring Christianity into the discussion.  Was Lord\nBacon a bootblack?  Was the Duke of Marlborough a crossing sweeper?\nIn the best Utopia, I must be prepared for the moral fall of any man\nin any position at any moment; especially for my fall from my position\nat this moment."

Why, I cannot imagine, nor can anybody tell me.\nFor some inconceivable cause a \"broad\" or \"liberal\" clergyman always\nmeans a man who wishes at least to diminish the number of miracles;\nit never means a man who wishes to increase that number.  It always\nmeans a man who is free to disbelieve that Christ came out of His grave;\nit never means a man who is free to believe that his own aunt came\nout of her grave.  It is common to find trouble in a parish because\nthe parish priest cannot admit that St. Peter walked on water;\nyet how rarely do we find trouble in a parish because the clergyman\nsays that his father walked on the Serpentine?  And this is not\nbecause (as the swift secularist debater would immediately retort)\nmiracles cannot be believed in our experience.  It is not because\n\"miracles do not happen,\" as in the dogma which Matthew Arnold recited\nwith simple faith.  More supernatural things are ALLEGED to have\nhappened in our time than would have been possible eighty years ago.\nMen of science believe in such marvels much more than they did:\nthe most perplexing, and even horrible, prodigies of mind and spirit\nare always being unveiled in modern psychology.  Things that the old\nscience at least would frankly have rejected as miracles are hourly\nbeing asserted by the new science.  The only thing which is still\nold-fashioned enough to reject miracles is the New Theology.\nBut in truth this notion that it is \"free\" to deny miracles has\nnothing to do with the evidence for or against them.  It is a lifeless\nverbal prejudice of which the original life and beginning was not\nin the freedom of thought, but simply in the dogma of materialism.\nThe man of the nineteenth century did not disbelieve in the\nResurrection because his liberal Christianity allowed him to doubt it.\nHe disbelieved in it because his very strict materialism did not allow\nhim to believe it.  Tennyson, a very typical nineteenth century man,\nuttered one of the instinctive truisms of his contemporaries when he\nsaid that there was faith in their honest doubt.  There was indeed.\nThose words have a profound and even a horrible truth.  In their\ndoubt of miracles there was a faith in a fixed and godless fate;\na deep and sincere faith in the incurable routine of the cosmos.\nThe doubts of the agnostic were only the dogmas of the monist."

Here we are only concerned with this clear point;\nthat in so far as the liberal idea of freedom can be said to be\non either side in the discussion about miracles, it is obviously\non the side of miracles.  Reform or (in the only tolerable sense)\nprogress means simply the gradual control of matter by mind.\nA miracle simply means the swift control of matter by mind.  If you\nwish to feed the people, you may think that feeding them miraculously\nin the wilderness is impossible—but you cannot think it illiberal.\nIf you really want poor children to go to the seaside, you cannot\nthink it illiberal that they should go there on flying dragons;\nyou can only think it unlikely.  A holiday, like Liberalism, only means\nthe liberty of man.  A miracle only means the liberty of God.\nYou may conscientiously deny either of them, but you cannot call\nyour denial a triumph of the liberal idea.  The Catholic Church\nbelieved that man and God both had a sort of spiritual freedom.\nCalvinism took away the freedom from man, but left it to God.\nScientific materialism binds the Creator Himself; it chains up\nGod as the Apocalypse chained the devil.

But if he can believe\nin miracles, he is certainly the more liberal for doing so;\nbecause they mean first, the freedom of the soul, and secondly,\nits control over the tyranny of circumstance.  Sometimes this truth\nis ignored in a singularly naive way, even by the ablest men.\nFor instance, Mr. Bernard Shaw speaks with hearty old-fashioned\ncontempt for the idea of miracles, as if they were a sort of breach\nof faith on the part of nature:  he seems strangely unconscious\nthat miracles are only the final flowers of his own favourite tree,\nthe doctrine of the omnipotence of will.  Just in the same way he calls\nthe desire for immortality a paltry selfishness, forgetting that he\nhas just called the desire for life a healthy and heroic selfishness.\nHow can it be noble to wish to make one's life infinite and yet\nmean to wish to make it immortal?

The author solemnly explained that\nthe two creeds were alike in things in which all creeds are alike,\nor else he described them as alike in some point in which they\nare quite obviously different.  Thus, as a case of the first class,\nhe said that both Christ and Buddha were called by the divine voice\ncoming out of the sky, as if you would expect the divine voice\nto come out of the coal-cellar. Or, again, it was gravely urged\nthat these two Eastern teachers, by a singular coincidence, both had\nto do with the washing of feet.  You might as well say that it was\na remarkable coincidence that they both had feet to wash.  And the\nother class of similarities were those which simply were not similar.\nThus this reconciler of the two religions draws earnest attention\nto the fact that at certain religious feasts the robe of the Lama\nis rent in pieces out of respect, and the remnants highly valued.\nBut this is the reverse of a resemblance, for the garments of Christ\nwere not rent in pieces out of respect, but out of derision;\nand the remnants were not highly valued except for what they would\nfetch in the rag shops.  It is rather like alluding to the obvious\nconnection between the two ceremonies of the sword:  when it taps\na man's shoulder, and when it cuts off his head.  It is not at all\nsimilar for the man.  These scraps of puerile pedantry would indeed\nmatter little if it were not also true that the alleged philosophical\nresemblances are also of these two kinds, either proving too much\nor not proving anything.  That Buddhism approves of mercy or of\nself-restraint is not to say that it is specially like Christianity;\nit is only to say that it is not utterly unlike all human existence.\nBuddhists disapprove in theory of cruelty or excess because all\nsane human beings disapprove in theory of cruelty or excess.\nBut to say that Buddhism and Christianity give the same philosophy\nof these things is simply false.  All humanity does agree that we are\nin a net of sin.

It is her instinct to say \"little\nchildren love one another\" rather than to tell one large person\nto love himself.  This is the intellectual abyss between Buddhism\nand Christianity; that for the Buddhist or Theosophist personality\nis the fall of man, for the Christian it is the purpose of God,\nthe whole point of his cosmic idea.  The world-soul of the Theosophists\nasks man to love it only in order that man may throw himself into it.\nBut the divine centre of Christianity actually threw man out of it\nin order that he might love it.  The oriental deity is like a giant\nwho should have lost his leg or hand and be always seeking to find it;\nbut the Christian power is like some giant who in a strange\ngenerosity should cut off his right hand, so that it might of its\nown accord shake hands with him.

That a man may love God\nit is necessary that there should be not only a God to be loved,\nbut a man to love him.  All those vague theosophical minds for whom\nthe universe is an immense melting-pot are exactly the minds which\nshrink instinctively from that earthquake saying of our Gospels,\nwhich declare that the Son of God came not with peace but with a\nsundering sword.

It is as true of democratic fraternity\nas a divine love; sham love ends in compromise and common philosophy;\nbut real love has always ended in bloodshed.  Yet there is another\nand yet more awful truth behind the obvious meaning of this utterance\nof our Lord.

It is written,\n\"Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\"  No; but the Lord thy God may\ntempt Himself; and it seems as if this was what happened in Gethsemane.\nIn a garden Satan tempted man:  and in a garden God tempted God.\nHe passed in some superhuman manner through our human horror\nof pessimism.  When the world shook and the sun was wiped out of heaven,\nit was not at the crucifixion, but at the cry from the cross:\nthe cry which confessed that God was forsaken of God.  And now let\nthe revolutionists choose a creed from all the creeds and a god from all\nthe gods of the world, carefully weighing all the gods of inevitable\nrecurrence and of unalterable power.  They will not find another god\nwho has himself been in revolt.  Nay, (the matter grows too difficult\nfor human speech,) but let the atheists themselves choose a god.\nThey will find only one divinity who ever uttered their isolation;\nonly one religion in which God seemed for an instant to be\nan atheist."

But the evidence in my case,\nas in that of the intelligent agnostic, is not really in this or that\nalleged demonstration; it is in an enormous accumulation of small\nbut unanimous facts.  The secularist is not to be blamed because\nhis objections to Christianity are miscellaneous and even scrappy;\nit is precisely such scrappy evidence that does convince the mind.\nI mean that a man may well be less convinced of a philosophy\nfrom four books, than from one book, one battle, one landscape,\nand one old friend.  The very fact that the things are of different\nkinds increases the importance of the fact that they all point\nto one conclusion.  Now, the non-Christianity of the average\neducated man to-day is almost always, to do him justice, made up\nof these loose but living experiences.  I can only say that my\nevidences for Christianity are of the same vivid but varied kind\nas his evidences against it.  For when I look at these various\nanti-Christian truths, I simply discover that none of them are true.\nI discover that the true tide and force of all the facts flows\nthe other way.  Let us take cases.  Many a sensible modern man\nmust have abandoned Christianity under the pressure of three such\nconverging convictions as these:  first, that men, with their shape,\nstructure, and sexuality, are, after all, very much like beasts,\na mere variety of the animal kingdom; second, that primeval religion\narose in ignorance and fear; third, that priests have blighted societies\nwith bitterness and gloom.  Those three anti-Christian arguments\nare very different; but they are all quite logical and legitimate;\nand they all converge.  The only objection to them (I discover)\nis that they are all untrue.  If you leave off looking at books\nabout beasts and men, if you begin to look at beasts and men then\n(if you have any humour or imagination, any sense of the frantic\nor the farcical) you will observe that the startling thing is not\nhow like man is to the brutes, but how unlike he is.  It is the\nmonstrous scale of his divergence that requires an explanation.\nThat man and brute are like is, in a sense, a truism; but that being\nso like they should then be so insanely unlike, that is the shock\nand the enigma.  That an ape has hands is far less interesting to the\nphilosopher than the fact that having hands he does next to nothing\nwith them; does not play knuckle-bones or the violin; does not carve\nmarble or carve mutton.  People talk of barbaric architecture and\ndebased art.  But elephants do not build colossal temples of ivory\neven in a roccoco style; camels do not paint even bad pictures,\nthough equipped with the material of many camel's-hair brushes.\nCertain modern dreamers say that ants and bees have a society superior\nto ours.  They have, indeed, a civilization; but that very truth\nonly reminds us that it is an inferior civilization.  Who ever\nfound an ant-hill decorated with the statues of celebrated ants?\nWho has seen a bee-hive carved with the images of gorgeous queens\nof old?  No; the chasm between man and other creatures may have\na natural explanation, but it is a chasm.  We talk of wild animals;\nbut man is the only wild animal.  It is man that has broken out.\nAll other animals are tame animals; following the rugged respectability\nof the tribe or type.  All other animals are domestic animals;\nman alone is ever undomestic, either as a profligate or a monk.\nSo that this first superficial reason for materialism is, if anything,\na reason for its opposite; it is exactly where biology leaves off that\nall religion begins."

Science knows nothing whatever about pre-historic man;\nfor the excellent reason that he is pre-historic.

First, for instance, that Jesus was a gentle creature,\nsheepish and unworldly, a mere ineffectual appeal to the world; second,\nthat Christianity arose and flourished in the dark ages of ignorance,\nand that to these the Church would drag us back; third, that the people\nstill strongly religious or (if you will) superstitious—such people\nas the Irish—are weak, unpractical, and behind the times.\nI only mention these ideas to affirm the same thing:  that when I\nlooked into them independently I found, not that the conclusions\nwere unphilosophical, but simply that the facts were not facts.\nInstead of looking at books and pictures about the New Testament I\nlooked at the New Testament.  There I found an account, not in the\nleast of a person with his hair parted in the middle or his hands\nclasped in appeal, but of an extraordinary being with lips of thunder\nand acts of lurid decision, flinging down tables, casting out devils,\npassing with the wild secrecy of the wind from mountain isolation to a\nsort of dreadful demagogy; a being who often acted like an angry god—\nand always like a god.  Christ had even a literary style of his own,\nnot to be found, I think, elsewhere; it consists of an almost furious\nuse of the A FORTIORI.  His \"how much more\" is piled one upon\nanother like castle upon castle in the clouds.  The diction used\nABOUT Christ has been, and perhaps wisely, sweet and submissive.\nBut the diction used by Christ is quite curiously gigantesque;\nit is full of camels leaping through needles and mountains hurled\ninto the sea.  Morally it is equally terrific; he called himself\na sword of slaughter, and told men to buy swords if they sold their\ncoats for them.  That he used other even wilder words on the side\nof non-resistance greatly increases the mystery; but it also,\nif anything, rather increases the violence.  We cannot even explain\nit by calling such a being insane; for insanity is usually along one\nconsistent channel.  The maniac is generally a monomaniac.  Here we\nmust remember the difficult definition of Christianity already given;\nChristianity is a superhuman paradox whereby two opposite passions\nmay blaze beside each other.

In another chapter I have indicated the fallacy\nof the ordinary supposition that the world must be impersonal because it\nis orderly.  A person is just as likely to desire an orderly thing\nas a disorderly thing.  But my own positive conviction that personal\ncreation is more conceivable than material fate, is, I admit,\nin a sense, undiscussable.  I will not call it a faith or an intuition,\nfor those words are mixed up with mere emotion, it is strictly\nan intellectual conviction; but it is a PRIMARY intellectual\nconviction like the certainty of self of the good of living.\nAny one who likes, therefore, may call my belief in God merely mystical;\nthe phrase is not worth fighting about.  But my belief that miracles\nhave happened in human history is not a mystical belief at all; I believe\nin them upon human evidences as I do in the discovery of America.\nUpon this point there is a simple logical fact that only requires\nto be stated and cleared up.  Somehow or other an extraordinary\nidea has arisen that the disbelievers in miracles consider them\ncoldly and fairly, while believers in miracles accept them only\nin connection with some dogma.  The fact is quite the other way.\nThe believers in miracles accept them (rightly or wrongly) because they\nhave evidence for them.  The disbelievers in miracles deny them\n(rightly or wrongly) because they have a doctrine against them.\nThe open, obvious, democratic thing is to believe an old apple-woman\nwhen she bears testimony to a miracle, just as you believe an old\napple-woman when she bears testimony to a murder.  The plain,\npopular course is to trust the peasant's word about the ghost\nexactly as far as you trust the peasant's word about the landlord.\nBeing a peasant he will probably have a great deal of healthy\nagnosticism about both.  Still you could fill the British Museum with\nevidence uttered by the peasant, and given in favour of the ghost.\nIf it comes to human testimony there is a choking cataract of human\ntestimony in favour of the supernatural.  If you reject it, you can\nonly mean one of two things.  You reject the peasant's story about\nthe ghost either because the man is a peasant or because the story\nis a ghost story.  That is, you either deny the main principle\nof democracy, or you affirm the main principle of materialism—\nthe abstract impossibility of miracle.  You have a perfect right\nto do so; but in that case you are the dogmatist.  It is we\nChristians who accept all actual evidence—it is you rationalists\nwho refuse actual evidence being constrained to do so by your creed.\nBut I am not constrained by any creed in the matter, and looking\nimpartially into certain miracles of mediaeval and modern times,\nI have come to the conclusion that they occurred.  All argument\nagainst these plain facts is always argument in a circle.  If I say,\n\"Mediaeval documents attest certain miracles as much as they attest\ncertain battles,\" they answer, \"But mediaevals were superstitious\";\nif I want to know in what they were superstitious, the only\nultimate answer is that they believed in the miracles.  If I say \"a\npeasant saw a ghost,\" I am told, \"But peasants are so credulous.\"\nIf I ask, \"Why credulous?\" the only answer is—that they see ghosts.\nIceland is impossible because only stupid sailors have seen it;\nand the sailors are only stupid because they say they have seen Iceland.\nIt is only fair to add that there is another argument that the\nunbeliever may rationally use against miracles, though he himself\ngenerally forgets to use it."

Suppose sixty excellent householders swore\nthat when angry they had seen this crimson cloud:  surely it would\nbe absurd to answer \"Oh, but you admit you were angry at the time.\"\nThey might reasonably rejoin (in a stentorian chorus), \"How the blazes\ncould we discover, without being angry, whether angry people see red?\"\nSo the saints and ascetics might rationally reply, \"Suppose that the\nquestion is whether believers can see visions—even then, if you\nare interested in visions it is no point to object to believers.\"\nYou are still arguing in a circle—in that old mad circle with which this\nbook began."

The greatest\ndisaster of the nineteenth century was this:  that men began\nto use the word \"spiritual\" as the same as the word \"good.\"\nThey thought that to grow in refinement and uncorporeality was\nto grow in virtue.  When scientific evolution was announced,\nsome feared that it would encourage mere animality.  It did worse:\nit encouraged mere spirituality.  It taught men to think that so long\nas they were passing from the ape they were going to the angel.\nBut you can pass from the ape and go to the devil.  A man of genius,\nvery typical of that time of bewilderment, expressed it perfectly.\nBenjamin Disraeli was right when he said he was on the side of\nthe angels.  He was indeed; he was on the side of the fallen angels.\nHe was not on the side of any mere appetite or animal brutality;\nbut he was on the side of all the imperialism of the princes\nof the abyss; he was on the side of arrogance and mystery,\nand contempt of all obvious good.  Between this sunken pride\nand the towering humilities of heaven there are, one must suppose,\nspirits of shapes and sizes.  Man, in encountering them,\nmust make much the same mistakes that he makes in encountering\nany other varied types in any other distant continent.  It must\nbe hard at first to know who is supreme and who is subordinate.\nIf a shade arose from the under world, and stared at Piccadilly,\nthat shade would not quite understand the idea of an ordinary\nclosed carriage.  He would suppose that the coachman on the box\nwas a triumphant conqueror, dragging behind him a kicking and\nimprisoned captive.  So, if we see spiritual facts for the first time,\nwe may mistake who is uppermost.  It is not enough to find the gods;\nthey are obvious; we must find God, the real chief of the gods.\nWe must have a long historic experience in supernatural phenomena—\nin order to discover which are really natural.  In this light I\nfind the history of Christianity, and even of its Hebrew origins,\nquite practical and clear.  It does not trouble me to be told\nthat the Hebrew god was one among many.  I know he was, without any\nresearch to tell me so.  Jehovah and Baal looked equally important,\njust as the sun and the moon looked the same size.  It is only\nslowly that we learn that the sun is immeasurably our master,\nand the small moon only our satellite.  Believing that there\nis a world of spirits, I shall walk in it as I do in the world\nof men, looking for the thing that I like and think good.\nJust as I should seek in a desert for clean water, or toil at\nthe North Pole to make a comfortable fire, so I shall search the\nland of void and vision until I find something fresh like water,\nand comforting like fire; until I find some place in eternity,\nwhere I am literally at home.

Once I saw suddenly the meaning of the shape\nof the cross; some day I may see suddenly the meaning of the shape\nof the mitre.  One fine morning I saw why windows were pointed;\nsome fine morning I may see why priests were shaven.  Plato has\ntold you a truth; but Plato is dead.  Shakespeare has startled you\nwith an image; but Shakespeare will not startle you with any more.\nBut imagine what it would be to live with such men still living,\nto know that Plato might break out with an original lecture to-morrow,\nor that at any moment Shakespeare might shatter everything with a\nsingle song.  The man who lives in contact with what he believes\nto be a living Church is a man always expecting to meet Plato\nand Shakespeare to-morrow at breakfast.  He is always expecting\nto see some truth that he has never seen before.  There is one\nonly other parallel to this position; and that is the parallel\nof the life in which we all began.  When your father told you,\nwalking about the garden, that bees stung or that roses smelt sweet,\nyou did not talk of taking the best out of his philosophy.  When the\nbees stung you, you did not call it an entertaining coincidence.\nWhen the rose smelt sweet you did not say \"My father is a rude,\nbarbaric symbol, enshrining (perhaps unconsciously) the deep\ndelicate truths that flowers smell.\"  No: you believed your father,\nbecause you had found him to be a living fountain of facts, a thing\nthat really knew more than you; a thing that would tell you truth\nto-morrow, as well as to-day. And if this was true of your father,\nit was even truer of your mother; at least it was true of mine,\nto whom this book is dedicated.  Now, when society is in a rather\nfutile fuss about the subjection of women, will no one say how much\nevery man owes to the tyranny and privilege of women, to the fact\nthat they alone rule education until education becomes futile:\nfor a boy is only sent to be taught at school when it is too late\nto teach him anything.  The real thing has been done already,\nand thank God it is nearly always done by women.  Every man\nis womanised, merely by being born.

This or that rite or doctrine may look\nas ugly and extraordinary as a rake; but I have found by experience\nthat such things end somehow in grass and flowers.  A clergyman may\nbe apparently as useless as a cat, but he is also as fascinating,\nfor there must be some strange reason for his existence.  I give\none instance out of a hundred; I have not myself any instinctive\nkinship with that enthusiasm for physical virginity, which has\ncertainly been a note of historic Christianity.  But when I look\nnot at myself but at the world, I perceive that this enthusiasm\nis not only a note of Christianity, but a note of Paganism, a note\nof high human nature in many spheres.  The Greeks felt virginity\nwhen they carved Artemis, the Romans when they robed the vestals,\nthe worst and wildest of the great Elizabethan playwrights clung to\nthe literal purity of a woman as to the central pillar of the world.\nAbove all, the modern world (even while mocking sexual innocence)\nhas flung itself into a generous idolatry of sexual innocence—\nthe great modern worship of children.  For any man who loves children\nwill agree that their peculiar beauty is hurt by a hint of physical sex.\nWith all this human experience, allied with the Christian authority,\nI simply conclude that I am wrong, and the church right; or rather\nthat I am defective, while the church is universal.

I do it because the thing has not merely told this\ntruth or that truth, but has revealed itself as a truth-telling thing.\nAll other philosophies say the things that plainly seem to be true;\nonly this philosophy has again and again said the thing that does\nnot seem to be true, but is true.  Alone of all creeds it is\nconvincing where it is not attractive; it turns out to be right,\nlike my father in the garden.  Theosophists for instance will preach\nan obviously attractive idea like re-incarnation; but if we wait\nfor its logical results, they are spiritual superciliousness and the\ncruelty of caste.  For if a man is a beggar by his own pre-natal sins,\npeople will tend to despise the beggar.  But Christianity preaches\nan obviously unattractive idea, such as original sin; but when we\nwait for its results, they are pathos and brotherhood, and a thunder\nof laughter and pity; for only with original sin we can at once pity\nthe beggar and distrust the king.  Men of science offer us health,\nan obvious benefit; it is only afterwards that we discover\nthat by health, they mean bodily slavery and spiritual tedium.\nOrthodoxy makes us jump by the sudden brink of hell; it is only\nafterwards that we realise that jumping was an athletic exercise\nhighly beneficial to our health.  It is only afterwards that we\nrealise that this danger is the root of all drama and romance.\nThe strongest argument for the divine grace is simply its ungraciousness.\nThe unpopular parts of Christianity turn out when examined to be\nthe very props of the people.  The outer ring of Christianity\nis a rigid guard of ethical abnegations and professional priests;\nbut inside that inhuman guard you will find the old human life\ndancing like children, and drinking wine like men; for Christianity\nis the only frame for pagan freedom.  But in the modern philosophy\nthe case is opposite; it is its outer ring that is obviously\nartistic and emancipated; its despair is within."

Here everything has a story tied\nto its tail, like the tools or pictures in my father's house;\nfor it is my father's house.

The primary paradox of\nChristianity is that the ordinary condition of man is not his sane\nor sensible condition; that the normal itself is an abnormality.\nThat is the inmost philosophy of the Fall.  In Sir Oliver Lodge's\ninteresting new Catechism, the first two questions were:\n\"What are you?\" and \"What, then, is the meaning of the Fall of Man?\"\nI remember amusing myself by writing my own answers to the questions;\nbut I soon found that they were very broken and agnostic answers.\nTo the question, \"What are you?\"  I could only answer, \"God knows.\"\nAnd to the question, \"What is meant by the Fall?\"  I could answer\nwith complete sincerity, \"That whatever I am, I am not myself.\"\nThis is the prime paradox of our religion; something that we have\nnever in any full sense known, is not only better than ourselves,\nbut even more natural to us than ourselves.  And there is really\nno test of this except the merely experimental one with which these\npages began, the test of the padded cell and the open door.

And the really interesting thing is this,\nthat the pagan was (in the main) happier and happier as he approached\nthe earth, but sadder and sadder as he approached the heavens.\nThe gaiety of the best Paganism, as in the playfulness of Catullus\nor Theocritus, is, indeed, an eternal gaiety never to be forgotten\nby a grateful humanity.  But it is all a gaiety about the facts of life,\nnot about its origin.  To the pagan the small things are as sweet\nas the small brooks breaking out of the mountain; but the broad things\nare as bitter as the sea.  When the pagan looks at the very core of the\ncosmos he is struck cold.  Behind the gods, who are merely despotic,\nsit the fates, who are deadly.  Nay, the fates are worse than deadly;\nthey are dead.  And when rationalists say that the ancient world\nwas more enlightened than the Christian, from their point of view\nthey are right.  For when they say \"enlightened\" they mean darkened\nwith incurable despair.  It is profoundly true that the ancient world\nwas more modern than the Christian.  The common bond is in the fact\nthat ancients and moderns have both been miserable about existence,\nabout everything, while mediaevals were happy about that at least.\nI freely grant that the pagans, like the moderns, were only miserable\nabout everything—they were quite jolly about everything else.\nI concede that the Christians of the Middle Ages were only at\npeace about everything—they were at war about everything else.\nBut if the question turn on the primary pivot of the cosmos,\nthen there was more cosmic contentment in the narrow and bloody\nstreets of Florence than in the theatre of Athens or the open garden\nof Epicurus.

Melancholy should be an innocent interlude,\na tender and fugitive frame of mind; praise should be the permanent\npulsation of the soul.  Pessimism is at best an emotional half-holiday;\njoy is the uproarious labour by which all things live.

Grief ought to be\na concentration; but for the agnostic its desolation is spread\nthrough an unthinkable eternity.  This is what I call being born\nupside down.  The sceptic may truly be said to be topsy-turvy;\nfor his feet are dancing upwards in idle ecstasies, while his brain\nis in the abyss.  To the modern man the heavens are actually below\nthe earth.  The explanation is simple; he is standing on his head;\nwhich is a very weak pedestal to stand on.  But when he has found\nhis feet again he knows it.
